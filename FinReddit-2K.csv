Stocks,GME,"u/hooman_or_whatever, I posted this as a reply to somebody but wanted you to see it in case you had any insight. The other poster's comment basically suggested that new shorts at the top were not squeezable. I super appreciate your posts!

>I disagree. I think all shorts are squeezable. The bottom line is that if 100% of the company is shorted, 100% has to be bought back, and must have interest paid on it in the meantime. A share sold short is downward pressure on the stock price, and upward pressure is owed back to the system. If I wanted to short a stock, I would sure as hell take that borrowed pressure into account before I invested. Shorting a company which is already shorted that deeply is too risky for me.

>The LOW price of GME on the day that 78.46% SI was reported was $250. Another interesting note is that the reported SI went above 200% when GME was worth around $4 and stayed there until the time window in which it dropped to 78.46%.

>So if short interest increased on the way down, as it likely did(not only to force the price down further, but for new money to capitalize on the high price), there will again be an unwinding of that position, some day.

>Whether the rest of the shorts unwound on the way down remains to be seen. I doubt it though based on all of the bots and disinformation campaigns. Someone has an interest in the price dropping, but I'm holding. And I will until I see solid proof that it's over. I think there is a real opportunity to force this issue and possibly affect real change. I want the government to investigate the shit out of this and put a stop to the manipulation.

I just finished reading Jeremy Siegel's book ""The Future for Investors"" and the entire auto industry feels a lot like the best performers that he found in his research. Consistent earnings with high div yields that is constantly undervalued because of people's fear of the future. America is a country built around autos, we're just too large and our cities too sprawling that it makes it infeasible to not own an auto for 95% of our population. The auto industry isn't going anywhere and as long as the big players pivot successfully they're going to perform well.",buy

wallstreetbets,BB,"Aight I'm talking out of my ass, as with everyone here, so plz don't take anything I say seriously.

The way I see it, two things are happening:

1, BB is/already has partnering/partnered with several large and successful companies over cybersecurity and EV stuff. This promises somewhat large, somewhat stable growth in the future as those companies grow as large companies do- obvs BB won't grow as much, but it's at least along for the ride.

2, the current massive fucking rocket is *mostly* BB stock adjusting to what it should be very rapidly. Not too much has fundamentally changed about BB, but considering that it's been doing all this shit for years and then opened the year at a price of 6.58? You best believe this shits undervalued. This has likely created a bubble dude to momentum, but the bubble is still going to pop at significantly higher than it's original price.

My prediction? Short term rocketing, bubble pops to a still high-ish value, then slowly grows. Fuckit I'll put random guess values in this: peaks at 25, pops and hits 15, grows to 20 by EOY. Absolute retard take there but whatevs.",buy

Lastly I think we are going to see a more investors interested in REITs (and REITs not backed by tenants on at-risk industries or with assets getting clobbered by WFH) to escape a lot of the market uncertainty with COVID.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

Info of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&ab_channel=StocksBigPlays

WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM DOING THIS FOREVER?

Well, unlike us retarded diamond handed monkeys, everyone with a short position has to pay daily interest on their positions to their broker. The longer they wait the more they have to pay to stay in the game. This is a war of attrition, but one side (us) does not have a financial penalty for staying on the battlefield, the other side (those with short positions) do.",buy

You can experience part of the world by paying to be there, you can become part of an artifact’s history by taking care of it for a while when you buy it. You can be part of a movement, a historical event, and you can be part of the future. 

Sometimes, and it might only come once in your life; God, I hope it only needs to come this once... sometimes you have to really be a part of something, something that crosses several of those boundaries. This is one of those moments. By buying and holding, this forces the same people who made horrible investments that brought our financial system; and many of us; to it’s and our knees in 2008 to feel the pain that they caused us.

wallstreetbets,AG,"You really really don't need to be in Robinhood Ever again.  
Why?  


Well, Consider the two most common beliefs as to why they restricted trading.  


1.) They are shills to their HedgeFund overlords.  


If thats true, then nothing changed, and their ability to repeat this whenever it fits is very clearly in tact, Not worth the risk.  


2.) They  were not liquid enough to cover the influx of orders.  


IF THATS true, then it would be silly to imagine a future where they wouldn't have this exact issue again, maybe weeks or years down the road.  


And Endpoint, They chose to tell the users a reason that was NEITHER of the above, which makes them more unsavory than either of the above IMHO, since it removes the concept of speculation and adds everything up to ""Lied to keep your money""

wallstreetbets,GME,"Remember. PSA part 500.

Premarket will help us build the hype.
Between 935-1015, we will see our big dip.
Buy during the dip.
Today is pay day for most, today call options are expiring and a large majority are in the money this morning.
This will cause the price to surge.
Hedge funds aren’t able to short much more if anything, and margin calls are also due today.
This will also have an impact on the price. 
As it rises, more and more calls will be executed in the money.
Do NOT be discouraged by the initial dip, it is an OPPORTUNITY, to invest for more shares at a lower price, so that your average is low. 

After 11, I have a strong feeling the stock will be above $150, and then climb with baby dips in between until power hour does put it through the roof because uncalled calls, will need to be executed.

We will be 💎🙌🏼 by EOD, HOLD, BUY, HOLD, with a few baby buys mixed in, and most importantly, HOLD.

I had many stocks bought in Nov 2020, and I could not hold them all the way down as when I realize I have no idea how to value a company, it's better for me to cut the loss. It turns out half the loss cut turns out great, and the other half the loss cut were wrong.

So before you suggest people to hold, you have to make sure they know how to value a company and there is enough risk management, simply asking people to hold is super bad.

Stocks,AG,"I'll lend my voice to this as I have a substantial position in UUUU and the physical holding company URPTF.  I've done my homework as well.

The thesis is very simple...pure arithmetic.  Prior to Fukushima there were close to 900 listed companies claiming to have something to do with uranium. With the price so high everyone with a drilling rig became a uranium explorer. Like all commodities, uranium went through yet another boom bust cycle aided by the Fukushima incident. Today there are less than 40 listed companies in the uranium space.

The cure for low prices is low prices

As Cameco recently demonstrated the price of uranium is UNSUSTAINABLY low. It is not profitable to mine the stuff under $50 and no new production will ever come online until a sustained price closer to $70 is reached. This means, in simple math, the supply is and will be less than the demand thus forcing the price of the commodity back to a sustainable level.  It really is that simple

Would you have turned your nose up when oil was in the teens a few years ago?  Was oil going out of style? Of course not. The time to buy oil was after the 08 financial crisis when no one wanted it and everyone was screaming that it would never recover...it's $80 now for Brent.

The same logic applies to uranium now.

As the topic post points out the demand is surging and the supply is diminishing...that can only mean one thing...higher prices. It's not an ""if"" question only a ""when""  question

Enter UUUU. UUUU has a very specific catalyst on the near term horizon...section 232 and a mandated quota requiring US utilities (100 of them) to buy 25% of their fuel from domestic sources. UUUU is the best capitalized, most liquid, largest producer with the ability to ramp up production quickly of the very few remaining US miners. The fact that there really are only 3 or 4 names to invest in is a huge bonus as is UUUUs ability to tap other markets like Vanadium which is at an all time high near $20. There simply is not other play with the leverage, skill, resources and advantages to take the lead in the new uranium bull market that MUST see the price recover to at least double the current spot price

If you study up on the two previous bull markets...2006 and 2011 you'll see that nothing but bitcoin can rival uranium. The market has a captive audience that cannot resort to alternatives. Nuclear is the ONLY carbon free base load provider of electricity and it's place in the world energy mix is very very secure.

I'm certainly talking my book here but it's because I've done the homework. We are at the very beginning of a supply demand crunch that will see uranium the top performing commodity over the next several years. It's simple arithmetic not rocket science. ",buy

pennystocks,ACB,"This thread cracks me up. All the cannabis has been pumped hard. GRWG just announced earnings and it exploded and tapered off. The only reason it exploded is because they are a grow supplier, not the grower. Everything else has gone down. 2 years ago, TLRY had an explosive run to $200+ a share as a”meme stock”. ACB failed so hard they had to do a reverse split. CGC is backed by constellation and used to trade over $50 a share. Snoop dog is invested in them, and they can’t get off the ground. HEXO is a joke. WTER is volatile as crap. Marijuana is decriminalized all over the country. And it’s STILL cheaper to buy from your local dealer.

Dividends,RKT,"I am not an expert, but...

Do you have to pay taxes on your inheritance IRA?  If not, I would put dividend stocks in there and use those dividends to take out what you need annually. 

I would then have some cheap index fund/ETF in your own long-term hold IRA, like VOO. And every time the market is down use those dividends to buy in more shares of the ETF. 

This way you will consistently will fuel money from inheritance to your IRA without really having to sell anything and relying on dividends.",other

wallstreetbets,AG,"I think the stock is worth $60 minimum and here's why:

It's all about the future, and GameStop's ability to pivot to ecommerce and away from brick and mortar with the help of our boy RC. Fundamentals matter very little when looking at certain stocks (like a lot of the companies in the EV space), and I think GameStop is one of them. It is irrelevant what multiples the name trades at currently, its all about the likelihood of the scenario playing out where a company dominates the market down the road. For GameStop its all about how likely they will be able to pivot to being a dominant player in the gaming ecommerce industry.

Just a few months ago, GME was viewed as a failing retail store that ripped people off (remember the memes? how much will GameStop offer me for this 1 day old console and games? $20!). GameStop's brand had little to no value, HOWEVER after this whole fiasco, the GameStop is worshiped by an entire generation of retail traders. GameStop could start selling hotdogs next week, and I have no doubt people would line up to buy them. This is huge because this generation of retail traders is generally younger, probably mostly male aka the EXACT target market that must be captured to successfully transition to niche gaming ecommerce. This essentially guarantees GameStop gets a chance at bat, and exponentially increases the odds of the scenario that GameStop will become a dominant player in gaming ecommerce. 

I know I said fundamentals don't matter, but lets quickly talk valuation. At $60 a share that would put GME's mkt cap at roughly $4bn. How much will this company be worth if they pull it off? 

Currently Chewy has a market cap of $42bn, but the gaming sector is already larger and growing much faster than the pet supplies industry. Assuming similar margins for both companies that are now dominant players in their respective sectors. I used assumptions for current market size and CAGR assumptions of what was the average of the top few studies on google, and found that in the year 2030 the gaming sector will be more than 4 times the size of the pet supplies industry. I wouldn't even know how to discount anything back to 2021 and highly doubt its possible to do it remotely accurately, but that alone is enough for me to know that this could be something big if GameStop can pull it off. I am talking easily $100bn mkt cap stock minimum without any squeeze.  

Former positions: I YOLOed at around $15 about half calls and half shares, sold 95% of my position by the time it hit $65, but still held 100 shares until $370 where I sold 50 and then the other 50 on the way down at $260. That being said, if/when this stock dips below $60, I am 110% buying back in and holding for the long term.",buy

The Fed can't fix supply side - but honestly that is becoming less imoortant anyway and more of an excuse. They have to address the demand-side now. The money supply skyrocketed in the pandemic as never before in history - I mean come on. Supply side is really more of an excuse now.

Problem is that historically 100bps will not be enough for 7.5%. When I hear the market priced in 6 hikes and 100bp - HILARIOUS. 😂

I realize the fund doesn’t move fast if your looking to sell but when I compare the monthly divided which averages out at 0.02 per share. 

Take the example of $200k @ $2.5 is 80,000 shares.
80,000 x .019 = $1,520 per month = 18,250 per year if your not reinvesting the monthly. 

Or is this money taboo because it would be looked at as a penny stock. 

But each time I compare many of the above mentioned stocks they don’t reach the same point. 

Could be I am missing something all together and if I am I would greatly appreciate the lesson learned.

StockMarket,ACB,"Options are a zero sum game. Covered calls basically reduce the volatility of the portfolio. To put into perspective: if the market is sideways the strategy will perform better than the market and positive, if market is trending up the strategy will perform worse than market but still positive and if market is trending down the strategy will perform better than market but will still lose money.

Markets are generally going up overtime so covered calls tend to underperform the market as their return/risk is very similar to a bond.

The only way this would be a good strategy is to have inside info about the stock, basically knowing more about the stock than the buyer of the call (basically never), because if the price wasn't fair nobody would buy that option. So if the seller and the buyer have the same amount of information this is a zero sum game in the end as no value is created and only risk is switched between parties.",other

investing,ACB,"William Roth was a Senator from Delaware, who introduced the concept of paying taxes on your retirement contributions at your **full marginal rate today** instead of at **progressive rates in retirement**.  This methodology was adopted for both Individual Retirement Accounts, and 401(k) (Employer) programs.  Thus, today we have Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s.

What we do NOT have is ""A Roth"".  *Roth* is an adjective, a modifier, a -type- of retirement account.  It is not a noun.  (It is also not an acronym -- a ROTH -- but you didn't make that mistake!)  

Still, you should not say *I have 70k in a Roth* -- unless you also look in the garage in the morning    
and say, *I think I'll drive the blue today* 😉.

investing,BB," Frequency Therapeutics (FREQ)

Good morning guys,

I saw that frequency therapeutics fell hard last week from around $40 to $8 and it has been stable between $8 and $9 for the past couple of days. The reason this happened was because trials regarding the treatment of hearing loss failed. However there is another medicine which is in trial which thusfar has shown more promise.

Is this a good investment now and does this have the potential to bounce back? It recently got upgraded to a buy (2.2). Will it go down even further before it goes up again or is this the lowest it will get?

In any case this one shows potential in my opinion and it will certainly go up but the question is when can we expect a rise of the stock.

My first pick is TEVA. They're a vast drugmaker doing generics and biosimilars whose price is depressed by a price fixing indictment. It is not in the government's interest to sink a good tax source, I therefore expect a fair settlement based on precedent. At approximately 5x pe and peg slightly under 1, I'm putting in a buy order once my bank sorts out my US paperwork.

StockMarket,GM,"good morning, traders! here are your notable earnings reports this morning-

> **Caterpillar**—The heavy equipment maker earned $1.72 per share for the third quarter, well above estimates of $1.36. CEO Doug Oberhelman noted that the company has been able to raise its own earnings targets even in the face of relatively flat sales, and the company raised its financial outlook for the year.

> **Comcast**—The broadcasting and cable company earned 73 cents per share for the third quarter, 2 ents above estimates, though revenue was slightly short. Comcast's results were helped by improved performance at CNBC parent NBCUniversal.
General Motors—The automaker reported profit of 97 cents per share, excluding certain items, beating estimates by 2 cents, though revenue was shy of forecasts.

> **United Continental**—The airline reported quarterly profit of $2.75 per share for the third quarter, 7 cents above estimates, with revenue also above consensus. CEO Jeff Smisek said the company still has the opportunity to increase efficiency and profit margins.

> **3M**—The conglomerate scored a 2-cent beat by earning $1.98 per share for the third quarter, though revenues were shy of consensus. 3M narrowed its yearly financial targets, citing negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations.

> **PulteGroup**—The home builder beat estimates by 1 cent with third quarter profit of 37 cents per share, on the strength of higher home prices. The company also raised its quarterly dividend by 60 percent to 8 cents per share.

> **Dunkin' Brands**—The restaurant chain earned 49 cents per share, excluding certain items, 2 cents above estimates. However, revenue fell short, and the company also warned that it may not reach its yearly sales targets.

> **Southwest Airlines**—The carrier earned 55 cents per share for its latest quarter, 2 cents above estimates, with revenue beating consensus. Southwest was helped by lower fuel costs and increased operating margins.

> **Eli Lilly**—The drug maker fell short of estimates by one cent with quarterly profit of 66 cents per share, though revenue beat estimates by a slight margin. Lilly's quarter was marked by several patent expirations, more generic competition, and the negative impact of a stronger dollar.

> **Under Armour**—The athletic apparel maker reported third quarter profit of 41 cents per share, 1 cent above estimates. Revenue beat analyst forecasts, and the company also raised its guidance for the full year, crediting strong sales of its footwear and outdoor apparel.

> **Quest Diagnostics**—The medical lab operator's quarterly profit came in 2 cents above estimates at $1.10 per share, with revenues above analyst forecasts as well. Quest saw better profit margins and customer volume at its labs during the quarter.

> **AT&T**—The telecoms giant missed estimates by a penny with quarterly profit of 63 cents per share. Revenue missed as well, and the company cut its full-year earnings outlook, amid an eight percent drop in average revenue per phone user.

> **Visa**—The financial services company raised its quarterly dividend by 20 percent, increasing the payout to 48 cents per share from the prior 40 cents.

> **Cheesecake Factory**—The restaurant chain fell 9 cents short of estimates with its third quarter profit of 48 cents per share, though revenue was slightly above consensus. The company did see sales growth, but also experienced an increase in expenses.

> **Citrix Systems**—The cloud computing and networking firm reported third quarter profit of 75 cents per share, 2 cents above estimates, but revenue was well short of consensus. The networking services company also projected full-year revenue below Street estimates.

> **Select Comfort**—The company beat estimates by 4 cents with third quarter profit of 44 cents, with revenue soundly beating analyst forecasts. The maker of Sleep Number mattresses also raised its full-year forecast on rising demand for its products.

> **Tractor Supply**—The farm equipment maker earned 55 cents per share for the third quarter, 5 cents above estimates, on the strength of stronger sales for the maker of farm products.

> **Yelp**—The company reported third quarter profit of 5 cents per share, 2 cents above estimates, with revenue beating as well. However, the consumer website operator also forecast worse-than-expected current quarter revenue.

> **Seagate Technology**—The company increased its quarterly dividend by 26 percent to 54 cents per share.

> **CarMax**—The used-car retailer increased its share buyback program by $2 billion to a total of $3.8 billion.

> **Nokia**—The communications and IT firm reported a stronger than expected third quarter profit, and also raised the outlook for its networking gear unit.

> **Procter & Gamble**—The manufacturer of home products announced the retirement of its North American business head, Melanie Healey, effective next June. Healey had once been considered to be a candidate to succeed current chief executive officer A.G. Lafley.",other

I seriously doubt you're going to be seeing 40, 50 or 100% gains in any of these in the next year. I do see you have CapitalOne, Blackrock, and a couple of other non-tech stocks here.

These numbers used to be memes, until they shorted the entire Russell 2000 and 90 some ETFs.

Anyway, what is confusing me about all this is the statistics, maybe its because I'm a retarded tendie loving idiot, so maybe someone could explain to me what I'm seeing.

On Yahoo Finance, It says that the percentage of shares owned by insiders is 27.33% and the percentage of shares held by institutions is 122.04%. How can there be more than 100% of a company? & that's not even including retail investors (or maybe it does, again, I'm retarded) 
Okay, that seems weird but what about this other stuff? like the fact that there are supposed to be a total of 69,000,000 shares outstanding, yet over 61,000,000 shares are shorted? is it really possible for there to be less than 8,000,000 shares that aren't being shorted? and if that was the case wouldn't there be no way for us (retail investors) to bring the price up at all? 🤔🤔🤔

Also, the short percentage of the float is 226.42% for Gamestop when I did research into the other top shorted stocks, Bed Bath and Beyond was mentioned so I decided to check their statistics versus Gamestop, and their percentage of the float was 82%. 

So i decided to compare the numbers of the Top 5 “Best Heavily Shorted Stocks To Buy Right Now” from Nasdaq.com 📈

just look at the stats: 

AMC 🎞

Shares Outstanding: 287.28M
% Held By Insiders: 2.30%
% Held by Institutions: 37.24% 
Shares Short: 44.67M
Short % of Float: 38.12%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 20.67%

GME 🎮

Shares Outstanding: 69.75M
% Held By Insiders: 27.33%
% Held by Institutions: 122.04%
Shares Short: 61.78M 
Short % of Float: 226.42%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 88.58%

BBBY 🧴

Shares Outstanding: 121.22M
% Held By Insiders: 5.76%
% Held by Institutions: 117.88%
Shares Short: 74.89M
Short % of Float: 82.41%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 61.78%

SPCE 🚀

Shares Outstanding: 234.34M
% Held By Insiders: 40%
% Held by Institutions: 29.72%
Shares Short: 38.6M 
Short % of Float: 56.15%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 16.47%

FUBO 📺

Shares Outstanding: 108.85M
% Held By Insiders: 17.38%
% Held by Institutions: 7.24%
Shares Short: 39.17M
Short % of Float: 72.74%
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 57.98%

As you can see Gamestop (GME) has the least amount of shares outstanding (by far) of any of these stocks, yet has the second most number of shares shorted behind BBBY which has almost DOUBLE the amount of shares outstanding. 

So, 
AMC has 15.5% of it’s total shares shorted
BBBY has 61.7% of its total shares shorted
FUBO has 35.98% of its total shares shorted
SPCE has 16.47% of its total shares shorted

But GME has 88.57% of it’s shares shorted!?!?!?!?

Look, I am not a financial advisor and none of this is financial advice, and I may be just a retard, but this retard thinks that everything going on with Gamestop is not just unsusal but downright strange. 

Is there any explanation that someone can give me that explains why GME is being shorted SO MUCH, and why it’s stats are like that? 🙌🏻💎",buy

Stocks,GM,"Assume an ETF has a stated annual expense ratio of 0.75%. On an investment of $50,000, the expected expense to be paid over the course of the year is $375. If the ETF returned precisely 0% for the year, the investor would slowly see his $50,000 move to a value of $49,625 over the course of the year. The net return the investor receives from the ETF is based on the total return the fund actually earned minus the stated expense ratio. For example, if the ETF perfectly tracks the Standard and Poor's 500 Index and the index itself returned 15% last year, the investor would see his ETF increase in value by 14.25%. This is the total return minus the stated expense ratio.",other

Stocks,BB,"Not a bad post, but I have some contrarian thought:

1. The BB - Amazon partnership smells to me like a jointly owned pre-spinoff play. Not sure Amazon/BB wanted to go through M&A or I think they would have already. The amount of cross-dependency required for IVY is weird to be just a partnership to expand their customer base for AWS. 

2. You are spot on about their positioning with OEMs. They have every advantage at being the de-facto market leader, provided OEMs adopt the services. However, from what I gathered from their recent webinar, the OEM play is more aimed at creating additional revenue streams for these partners, than ‘owning data’ and batting with Google, etc over data ownership. 

3. This is a category creating product. By definition, Blackberry and Amazon are self-disrupting their current products, together, I might add - to become the world leader when it comes to cloud IoT data @ edge, and providing a connected platform for moving systems. Note moving systems. EVs are just the niche market where this starts. I’m almost certain Amazon wants this product for their inevitable movement into last mile delivery with autonomous systems (cars, drones, etc). Their missing piece was embedded hardware and endpoint security - 2 things BB has the biggest moat in. Its too bad Christensen wont get to see the potential of ‘would be’ Enterprise incumbents mastering his ethos. If they can pull this off, it will be a defining moment, and case study taught in schools.

4. Im also very bullish on players like NET overtaking AWS when it comes to cloud services. I think this team has realized how competitive the space has gotten, and the investments they made into IaaS were pivotal for the movement to cloud, but are now anchors as the world moves into cloud @ edge. This play with BB can give them new life, and a new rev stream to offset potential losses/investment required over the next 10 years to keep AWS competitive in the market.

5. With any new market, there is always intangible risk. To me, this almost looks too good to be true. I cant see how this team can’t pull it off. This endeavour pretty much rests on the ability for developers to adopt the ecosystem and build on the platform — otherwise it will be just another ‘would-be’ platform play with no interest from devs. Both amazon and bb aren’t great at creating developer first ecosystems, which in my mind is their biggest risk factor. Once this is addressed, we can start celebrating.  

Tl;Dr: i am very bullish here, and only getting more excited. If these two can pull this off, it is going to be an event for the record books. Hodlers will probably make a lot of money if IVY is well received by developers.",buy

StockMarket,HIMS,"Anyone who says anything like ""I'm not gonna close any puts"" or ""It's \[fill-in-the-blank\] or bust"" or anything like that is not a professional trader. Meaning, they are almost definitely NOT profitable over a sizable (5+ years) time window.

Then again, this is not a forum for professional traders. Mostly because professional traders are... talking with other professional traders...? I mean, look at this comment: ""Bulls fuck bears hard but depressions fuck bulls with the unstoppable grind of a tectonic dick. Anyone thinking that a depression is not coming to the USA is fucking delusional."" What is that? It's like the comment section of a Worldstarhiphop video.

Legit advice from a professional trader? Study what happened over Christmas 2018. Mnuchin's call on Sunday, the Monday publishing of the letter and the market fall, the holiday break (Tues), and the insane rally that lasted up until the recent highs. We are trading a centrally-managed mixed-economy with very little price discovery and a ton of algo trading. You're going to try and ""predict that"" based on ""fundamentals""? Good luck.

Ride the waves. Ride them up, ride them down. Buy things as they go up, sell them as they go down. Trade a SPREAD. Do not ""smack the bid like a bitch"" or ""destroy the offer"" to ""prove to the world"" (or even lamer--a subreddit) that you're the smartest person in the virtual room. Spoiler alert: you're not. And it's an expensive game to play, with a nearly useless reward if you don't know what to do with a (small) fortune anyway.",other

Stocks,NOK,"I think is a very undervalued company. It is true that their phones adventure probably is going to end but their 5G adventure has just begun. Thats explains why the shifting and why they are rebalancing assets and workers...**It ""just"" 10% of the workers**... **Logically, 10%, and logically every big company, even Amazon, had to take hard choices, including firing workers and look what Amazon is today**. Especially in such a harsh moments for a lot of companies like this Pandemic...In every crisis there is opportunities and i think Nokia is taking the opportunity to turn on the engines again. As a company reposition in the correct market.

They are going to partner with Microsoft, Google, Amazon to develop 5G and Cloud infraestructure (if they don't have already). There are mainly 4 developers of 5 G as far i know. Nokia, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. The Americans are rising scepticism about Huawei due to the spionage and hackings turmoil. Ericsson just has started a battle with Samsung about patents that i don;t see how is beneficial. And we have Nokia, a company in almost historical low records but with a clear path shift and consolidated partnerships, not only with the BigTech but also with more than 100 countries around the world. I am smelling here there is a potential comeback but, yes, the financials are bad. I am not an expert but something is telling me that this IOT stuff, and 5G stuff, Nokia is going to say a lot because many govs, rising govs, don't wanna put their critical infraestructure under chinese Huawei surveillance orbit. Even Huawei is forced to be delisted from American Stocks i guess. The people and companies who are promoting Huawei is because they are pouring them with money. Until, the gov bans them. I think there is something boiling under the radar in terms of security and is a matter of time they are being forced to choose. So. In case of Nok. I think they have a potential comeback, taking into account the impact of 5G-IOT in full implementation, new internet speeds, their know-how in connectivity, the players and the last catalysts.

I forgot, also rumours of acquisitions around. Microsoft, AT&T and others i guess.

What i am not sure is the impact of Starlink internet. If they are competitors, is a paralel connectivity or what. Cuz that project is quite silent always.

**Personally**, i think is a very undervalued company and it is a cornerstone of the 5G independence in Europe, Latam, maybe America, maybe India...

Sellers had to look for other buyers as funds could not be released etc. Their goal after funding is selling the loan right away. Sometimes they disclose it. Other times they did not.  I have not seen much request coming from them on appraisals since Covid. I assume their revenue are impacted. They were once the only online lender and now there are three more online lenders. Some are even worse not reputable like boa, C etc.   Now with a mortage interest rate going through the roof at 4.65% for 30 year with up 1.9% more to go, I question if its revenue can sustain.

I drafted the below letter for us to send to our representatives about Robinhood . I tried posting it here, but Reddit isn’t letting me. 


> [Salutation]

> The brokerage Robinhood has manipulated the stock market by allowing only sells (and disallowing buys) on some of the highest volume stocks on the market this week (e.g. GME, AMC).  It would also appear that Robinhood has a financial conflict of interest given its dependency on Citadel, who has a financial interest in seeing some of these shares decline. Obviously if investors can only sell (and not buy) a particular stock, that stock will decline in value. 



> Allowing brokerages to arbitrarily place their thumb on the scales of the stock market will only serve to reduce liquidity on the market, which will in turn lead to lower valuations and performance of the overall market. Rather than serving as a neutral intermediary, this puts brokerages in the position of picking winners and losers.  Taken to its extreme, this policy would fragment the stock market like the current video streaming market.  Investors would have to research which brokers permit them to trade a particular stock, which is obviously ridiculous. 



> The stock market is supposed to be transparent and fair for all investors. Allowing brokerages to arbitrarily restrict the purchase and sale of securities is terrible policy and likely illegal. 


> Please launch an investigation into Robinhood immediately.

investing,NOK,"first of all, you should always think about ways to reduce risk to yourself. One should avoid investing in markets correlated to your living situation. For example, someone living in silicon valley, should not take all his money to buy a house in SV and then also do tons of angel investing. If something goes wrong, you lose everything. You want to seek out natural hedges based on your location and vocation. 

Since I have friends who are Texans, and you are in a similar situation to them, i'd give you similar recommendations

A)Diversifying outside of Norway:
The benchmark index is literally all oil and gas. The entire country is heavily driven by oil and gas. Get out of it, there is a whole world out there that benefit from cheap oil and gas.  

B)Look for natural hedges to oil:
You want to naturally take a synthetic short position to oil as much as you because your livelihood likely relies on Norway doing well. Oil doing poorly means the local economy would probably be bad and your job stability would be bad. So you want investments that should go up if oil and gas tank. Examples include major oil importers with strong growth potential such as India and Indonesia (who don't have the geopolitical issues of Turkey), just buy broad based country indexes since you aren't a stock picker. Another play is on a stronger dollar, which is generally correlated to weak oil. A strong dollar can be played by investing either in U.S. treasury paper or blue-chip stocks with high U.S. revenue base. 

I would allocate it like such:

25% US Treasuries
25% US blue chips
25% India Index
25% Indonesia Index

Stocks,BB,"Check out their newly branded Customer Relationship Summary (CRS FORM) released December 14th. Then check out the neat area called
 “We clarified some of our conflicts of interest including adding some new details on fractional shares and principal trading”
I was one of the first to strike my shovel in this dirt. 
And it’s not easy diggin.
RH will restrict users who “abuse” the fractional rounding function from fractional purchases. Think a buy 9 get the 10th coffee free stamp card. With notional transactions with a cost basis of $0.01 for 0.xxxxxx shares, some tickets equate to a 1:1 ratio on fractional rounding, which is fucking bonkers knowing this can be set to a 1:100 ratio using sub-fractional rounding (Market Makers Function to provide liquidity) 
It takes roughly 6,000 orders before they notice your account has done something only they should be able to do. (my thumbs hurt but it was worth it to email an executive who threatened to close my account) 
I told them they should have no reason to restrict me from purchasing fractional shares as RH offers commission free trading and no limit to order volume. They responded with some article violation in one of the clauses not stating why what I did was wrong but only that they can change the conditions of a users account as they see needed. 
So I responded with a question, would purchasing fractional shares to incur a higher cost average with no limit to order volume lead to the same restrictions as purchasing fractional shares at the lowest cost average of $0.01 per order. Essentially.
Do they kill the cat for eating to little? Or to much? 
They only responded with yes, and then reiterated the ability to change user conditions as needed. 
Two days later that CRS form got updated, one key difference regarding fractional purchases is the scale of $0.01-$0.03. If you go into RH and purchases at the cost basis of $0.01 you purchase at the cost average Robinhood MM purchases the shares they have in their holdings that are then, wait for it. Purchased by RH customers and users. That’s right, back in 2016-2018 you will see massive rises in volume across multiple markets. That was RH allotting their holdings to register in MM name to be lent to customers at RH, this can be cross referenced with cost average $0.01 order displaying the original share price when purchased.
This means not only does RH MM have these shares registered in their name, they make the profit from the cost average difference of the current asking price when you purchase a share vs when they bought in 2016-2018. Throw in PFOF and share lending and you get a monopoly. 
Now on to the key segment of fractional purchasing on RH. As stated in the new CRS form, if RH MM does not have sufficient shares in holdings to supply fractional liquidity to customers they will buy a whole share at current market price to break it up for you, even if it is a loss at their expense. Something has changed. Something has really changed. Meaning if you collectively purchased fractionally you would be forcing a MM to purchase whole lots which causes price discovery. Rather then pre provided fractional shares from 4 years ago.

BUT, my account now shows a value $58,600ish, and I have ALL my principle, $33k, as cash, while I still own 334 shares of stock.

What the heck just happened?  It shows me in the red $7kish, and the value of the stocks at $25kish, but somehow the value is $58kish, and if I understand anything, I could presumably take the $33k in cash and buy even more shares, or transfer it back into my bank account and hold without a pit in my stomach going forward.

Did they do a stock split?  Did my stocks somehow pay dividends already?  I'm probably asking retarded questions, because I have no idea what is going on.

50 different companies are restricted to buying from 1 - 5 shares. What they all have in common ?

They and multiple other brokers and hedge funds colluded for some nice market manipulation. They had no problem with any market manipulation before, they knowlingly let the shorts double down x20 and escalate the situation, do naked shorting etc., some brokerages are selling off peoples shares, many are executing their options or making their margin calls at the lowest price points possible.

[https://www.moneylaundering.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BetterMarkets.Report.SixBiggestBanks.122420.pdf](https://www.moneylaundering.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BetterMarkets.Report.SixBiggestBanks.122420.pdf)

Of course new 30 karma fresh account comes in with Hedge fund supportive narrative and this is the only sub that would eat this crap up honestly from all of the subs.

You would also have a case if Interactive Brokers CEO didn't incriminate himself on live TV on what was actually happening.

Wall Street's Crime Spree*395 major legal actions and $195 bln in fines and settlements over the last 20 years.*

the alleged or settled illegal conduct spans almost every conceivable type of financial crime or violation:

**• money laundering;• bribery;• massive fraud in the sale of mortgage-backed securities;• credit card and checking account abuses;• foreclosure and debt collection violations;• breaches of fiduciary duty;• antitrust violations;• market manipulation;• enabling Ponzi schemes• violations of election law.**

When even brokerages own workers come out in disgust against their company, politicians and law makers across the entire political moral compass agrees, good luck with pushing your narrative. They all knew what could and would happen for half a year, they didn't regulate or do anything until they cordinated.

Edit - only retailers were locked out from buying",other
Stocks,GM,"This is nothing new, they offer this before layoffs every time. Same thing happened in 2019 before layoffs. They always start with trimming the cream at the top (500 directors, executives were let go last week) then they offer the masses the buyout to have people leave on their own. Mostly its to encourage those people hanging on who are close to retirement to amicably leave or jumpstart their retirement.  Others may leave in the process too and it just helps trim the fat even more.

Good questions to ask would be:

Why do they hire ridiculously so they get overinflated in some areas and still underinflated/understaffed in other areas? 

Why does the ceo compensation not get lowered when the company looks to saving money? We are talking about $30 million dollars for just one person. Is she really creating the value to earn $30 million a year. Its a resounding NO. she isn't an owner of the company she is simply the highest employee. This is ridiculous overpay and applies to all ceos im all the fortune 500s.  Whenever cost cutting is implemented it rarely impacts the ceo and top executives compensations.",other

It sounds like you never should have started and the fact that you need the internet to tell you to stop hints that you developed an addiction.

You can become a profitable trader but you should definitely stick to safer strategies for a few years before you do anything with options unless you put a lot of hours into learning how options work but even then it takes a few months to put that information to use properly so you should start with extremely small positions. 

But all of that’s a moot point anyways because assuming you goal is long term wealth not short term income than trading is the worse thing you could do with your capital.

The prices are better than our local grocery stores and we spend less weekly on groceries than we ever have. It’s also incredibly convenient because they deliver to our door. Upon talking with the drivers, they are driving from the nearest large city, so around an hour to deliver groceries and they hit several homes in my neighborhood.

I haven’t invested and likely won’t but I see three scenarios: the opportunity to make 25%+ in the next year if you sell when they go public. You hold long long (3-5 years) and gain 1000% or it dwindles to $0-1 before they call it quits.",sell
